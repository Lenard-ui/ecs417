                The area <br>
                Mile end isnt the safest area of London <br>
                so going out at nght is a little dangerous
            </p>
            <p>
                The city <br>
                all in all London is a cool place to live in <br>
                it is a vibrant Metropolis with many diversities
            </p>
            <p>
                The country <br>
                After moving here from Germany I can say that so <br>
                far I am very satisfied with the british society.
